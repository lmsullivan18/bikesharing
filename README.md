# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to learn more about how customers use citi bikes. Based on our findings, we can propose other bikesharing services in other cities.

# Results
Within the Tableau Story, there are various visualizations that share more information about how customers use citi bikes. Based on the bikes by gender slide, it is clear that more men use the citi bike service than women. Based on the graph showing the number of bike trips by time, it is clear that commuting hours are the most popular times for the bikes - the highest concentration of trips is weekdays around 8am, and evenings around 5pm and 6pm. Interesstingly, there appears to be less bike trips on Wednesday evenings compared to other days of the week. Men and women seem to have similar usage patterns around the bikes. Most bikes are used for a very short trip duration, only about 10-20 minutes per ride.

# Summary
In general, men use the citi bike service more than men. In my opinion, that means citi bike has an opportunity to target women with compelling marketing to encourage more people to try the service. For future analysis, I would like to see bike usage compared with marketing efforts to see if that drives an increased number of rides. I'd also be interested to compare bike usage with weather, to see exactly when use picks up and dies down. I would be curious to see, as temperature are people comfortable using the bikes, and at what temperature do they stop being ok with it.
